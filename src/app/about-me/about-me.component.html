            <p>After graduating in 2014 with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Coumputer Science Engineering, I spent the last 3 years
                working both as a freelance developer and designer and as part of a team in various companies across Bangalore
                and Delhi. I acquired project and time management skills, as well as the ability to communicate with team
                members and clients while effectively meeting milestones and deadlines.<br> As a freelance developer and
                designer I collaborated with several graphic designers in Bangalore. I have worked on a multitude of web
                based projects for a range of clients providing Web Design (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) and Development
                (PHP, HTML, CSS, LESS, JS, jQuery, WordPress, WooCommerce, Bootstrap, Responsive Layouts), eCommerce Solutions,
                Corporate Branding and Graphic Design.<br> I Have a keen understanding of wireframes, sitemaps and user experience
                design which I put to good use on every project I work on. I am currently working in Bangalore, India. I
                am always available to discuss your project over the phone or via Skype. These days I enjoy spending my free
                time riding my bike, swimming or camping.</p>
